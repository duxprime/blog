# Sequelitis
With the recent home release of the last episode of Star Wars sequel trilogy, as well as the final entry in the so-called Skywalker Saga, I wanted to articulate my feelings on the state of the brand at large. 

After the first Star Wars movie since Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm was released, I've had a sense of doubt about the direction (or lack thereof) of the sequel trilogy. I had hoped that, over the course of three episodes, the latest additions to the main Star Wars narrative would have coalesced to bear fruit. Unfortunately, with the release of *The Rise of Skywalker*, I can say that wasn't the case for me. If I had to use a phrase to describe it, it would be "missed opportunity."

## Preface
I want to preface this by saying that I am deeply invested in Star Wars both as a cultural icon, and as a fictional universe with rich lore and characters that have been established over more than 40 years. That said, I didn't have irrational expectations of fan service that this new trilogy should somehow rehash or adapt the old extended universe. Frankly, for each good thing that came out of the EU, there was at least two bad things (and that's being generous). 

That doesn't mean that I didn't have expectations about storytelling in the universe itself. In any piece of fiction that is to be sufficiently expansive, with side stories and a timeline spanning generations, new entries need to get more than just the look and feel right. Internal consistency within a fictional universe is hugely important, but criticisms of this type are often shot down as being pedantic. 

However, new fiction that doesn't mind the precedents and norms established previously deflates the stakes and causes every moment to feel like a plot device rather than a plausible occurrence within a larger experience. It also just makes everything feel less cohesive, leading to reduced immersion and suspension of disbelief. Stories told in these universes have the burden of being both a competent narrative while also juggling the baggage and expectations of telling a story in an established settings. This a throughline that permeates a lot of my critique of the sequel trilogy.

## Motivation

The sequel trilogy has a confused identity. It is ostensibly meant to be a bona fide continuation of the previous two trilogies, going so far as to feature the original cast and characters in non-trivial roles. The title crawl with campy serial prose, the screen wipe transitions, an orchestral John Williams score, and a "used future" aesthetic are all present and accounted for. The qualities for a proper sequel mostly end there.

Thematically, the story seems to be a soft reboot of the franchise. The state of the galaxy is reset to where it was at the beginning of the original trilogy: an oppressive military force being opposed by a rag-tag group of freedom fighters who don't have support from their crumbling government, except now they're called The First Order and The Resistance instead of The Galactic Empire and The Rebel Alliance, respectively. 

 The arc of the hard-won victory of the previous trilogy has effectively been negated and we are given no on-screen exposition to justify the current state of affairs. There was a cut scene from TFA where one of Leia's aids warns the Republic senate about the First Order and is turned away, establishing at least *some* reason for an unsanctioned group of guerilla fighters. This still doesn't address how the First Order came to acquire the military presence it has at the outset. 
 
 The simple explanation is that the in-universe justification *didn't matter* to the story group and filmmakers. Every creative decision was made in service of creating a narrative that presented something familiar with a new coat of paint. *The Force Awakens*, more than any of the other three films, is most guilty of this. It is nearly a beat-for-beat remake of *A New Hope*. 
 * There is a desert planet where the call to action happens for the main character in Jakku.
 * There is a droid carrying vital information for the band of fighters in BB8.
 * A man dressed in black wearing a mask wields the Force to enact the will of a mysterious cult leader in Kylo Ren and Snoke.
 * There is a spherical, planet-sized super weapon in Starkiller base.
 * There is a grizzled, old mentor from the previous trilogy in Han Solo.
 * The mentor dies as part of the daring infiltration on the super weapon.
 * The small squadron of snub fighters finds a weakness in the super weapon to take it down and save the day.

The motivation for wanting to repackage the same ideas from the OT for a new generation seems to not be for storytelling reasons but rather, purely financial ones. It's almost as if these films were conceived in a board room full of Disney executives trying to create the most brand recognition and induce maximum nostalgia to get the best return on their investment. All of the Star Wars edge dressing is there, but in a very much paint-by-numbers kind of way.

## Design and Aesthetic

In some ways, the sequel trilogy is slavish to the design ideals of the original trilogy. The starfighters of The Resistance and The First Order are nearly identical to the iconic ships we see used by the rebels and imperials previously. In-universe, this is explained as newer models of those original designs, but that reason seems hollow. 30 years have passed since *Return of the Jedi*--a similar amount of time to the gap between the prequels and the original trilogy. 

If The Resistance were using old gear due to being underfunded, why not *literally* have them flying old X-Wings from the OT era? Similarly, if the FO were manufacturing new ships (never mind how they had the funds for it), why would they do so in the image of the Empire? It was never established, beyond Kylo's Vader imitation, that the First Order was some group of Empire loyalists or an Imperial remnant.

The same criticisms apply to the designs of the ground forces of the First Order. By now, introducing novel trooper designs is a bit of a tradition for new Star Wars media. The ST does this with some designs, like the flame trooper and Sith trooper, but is derivative with the standard storm trooper and TIE fighter pilot. Again, why would the gear not have evolved as much as it did between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy? 

The real answer, I suspect, is much like it is for other aspects that harken back to the original trilogy. Things should be different but only different enough to not appear like a carbon copy. The aesthetic familiarity needs to be there to sufficiently evoke nostalgia. 

In other ways, the sequel trilogy tried to forge its own visual identity for no reason. For example, beyond established characters like Chewbacca, Admiral Ackbar and Nien Nunb, almost no legacy alien races appear. Mainstays like Twi'leks, Rodians, Gran, Duros, or Trandoshans are nowhere to be seen. Even during the casino scene on Canto Bight, where we see a plethora of aliens, not a single one is an established race (despite the [concept art](https://i.redd.it/vxv1nje8c5811.jpg) depicting them). The choice to omit these while including other iconic visuals is baffling. These kinds of cues are core to what makes the universe *feel* like Star Wars and connect it visually to other media.

## Rey 
There has been much debate about the topic of Rey being someone of note. Abrams—in typical JJ fashion—laid out many mystery boxes in TFA, among them the question of Rey's parentage. Many say that Rian Johnson revealing in *The Last Jedi* that she was a nobody was positive character development because it allowed the character to stand on its own. That would be true if it was the intent from the start, but that ship had already sailed.  

What we are told in TLJ doesn't narratively jibe with what was seen previously. If Rey being no one was truly the intent:

* Why have a flashback scene of her being abandoned with no clear view of the parents?

* Why not give her a proper surname to put to rest the question of her being related to someone known?

* Why make her reuniting with and learning the identity of her parents such a strong motivation for the first half of the film?

* Why show her having such an immediately strong connection with Han as a red herring to tease a relation to someone we already know?

The fact that she was able to gain proficiency in the Force so quickly without any training suggests there is something more to her, even within the first film (Jedi mind trick manifesting through osmosis, resisting Kylo's mind probe when no one else can). The Force calling out to her through Anakin's saber is another cue (which would become retconned in TRoS into an intentional misdirection) that she may be a biological Skywalker. That she might be born of a bloodline with latent force potential is strongly hinted at by this and the other things we see.

Expecting closure for a question set up by the by the first film of a trilogy is certainly justified. As a narrative element, lineage was established early on. To not pay that off in subsequent films, or worse—to shut it down entirely the way Rian did in TLJ—is not subverting expectations. It's unsatisfying storytelling; the narrative equivalent of blue balls.

All of that said, making Rey a Palpatine was also not a great way to resolve this plot thread. This development in TRoS was almost certainly an ad-hoc addition that let JJ to pick up the narrative that Rian tried to cauterize.
